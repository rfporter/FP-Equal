LabVIEW Versions:
LV >=8.6 (Windows)

Dependencies:
LAVA Palette

Description:
This package contains VIs for testing equality of floating point numbers within a specified tolerance. Absolute Epsilon comparison, Relative Epsilon comparison and the ULP comparison have been implemented as described in this blog post by Bruce Dawson: 
http://randomascii.wordpress.com/2012/02/25/comparing-floating-point-numbers-2012-edition/

Note that the ULP comparison has not been implemented for extended precision floating point type.
 

Installation and instructions:
Install VIP package using VI Package Manager.

Examples:
"<LabVIEW>\examples\LAVA\AlmostEqual\AlmostEqual_Example 1.vi"	Demonstrates the usage of all three AlmostEqual functions.
"<LabVIEW>\examples\LAVA\AlmostEqual\AlmostEqual_Example 2.vi"	Demonstrates a case where exactly equal fails to produce the expected result.

Known Issues:
ULP comparison has not been implemented for extended precision floating point type.

Acknowledgements:
Bruce Dawson: Code of this package was inspired by his blog post on comparing floating point numbers (http://randomascii.wordpress.com/2012/02/25/comparing-floating-point-numbers-2012-edition/).

Version History:
v1.0.0: Initial release of the code.
